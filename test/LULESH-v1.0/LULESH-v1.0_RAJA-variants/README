# This directory contains three different versions of LULESH-1.0, all
# using RAJA:
#
# 1) luleshRAJA-serial.cxx contains a serial-only version.
# 2) luleshRAJA-parallel.cxx.src contains a version that can be run 
#    in 10 different parallel variants using RAJA (different data layouts,
#    different OpenMP parallelization strategies (including lock-free
#    dependency graphs), CilkPlus, and GPU using CUDA). See luleshPolicy.hxx
#    more more details and how to select the exeuction mode.
# 3) luleshRAJA-parallel-FT.cxx contains a version of #2, but with a
#    loop-level fault tolerance mechanism enabled. All loops in the FT
#    version are idempotent.
