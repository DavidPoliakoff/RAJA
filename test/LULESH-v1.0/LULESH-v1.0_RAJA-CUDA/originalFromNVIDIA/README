# This code does not use RAJA code directly. It uses a subset of RAJA-like
# features extracted for the purposes of working with NVIDIA to explore 
# launching CUDA kernels under the RAJA layer without directly programming
# to CUDA in the LULESH code.
#
# A true integration of this LULESH-RAJA-CUDA code into RAJA is forthcoming...
